    <h1>I Don't Respond With Technology...<br>And Maybe I Shouldn't</h1> 
        <section>
            <h2>Technology Ignoring Tendencies</h2> 
                <p>
                    After realizing that I had a lot more messages 
                    in my inbox than in my outbox, on many different platforms, 
                    I started to think about why that might be. I was friends With
                    most of the people that I left unanswered, so why was I not responding?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This led to a data collection project to help me learn who I
                    wasn't responding to and why. I collected data for a week. I recorded
                    details about when I recieved messages and when I responded. 
                    The messages that I deliberately set aside for later were categorized.
                    I recorded details about the platform the messages were on,
                    the people who sent them, what I was doing when I received them, and 
                    why I didn't respond.

            <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>As it turns out, many people who provide messaging services, Facebook, 
                    T-mobile, Google, are largely unregulated in what they can do with
                    my data... and yours. After thinking long and hard about why I never responded, 
                    I realized that it was too convenient to respond. The Technology
                    wasn't the reason. And the convenience of these applications and features
                    allow them to collect data and learn about users without anyone
                    stopping the services.
